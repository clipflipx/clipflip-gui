# clipflip-gui
**All-in-one package for exploiters**
# Version 1
This is proven to be stable on most executors, you may have issues with certain features depending on your exploit
``loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clipflip-exploits/clipflip-gui/main/v1'))()``
# Version 2
Unstable development version. Gets updated fairly often.
Note: If you use Incognito, it will load the fallback GUI (v1 GUI), as our v2 GUI lib is currently unsupported by Incognito
``loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clipflip-exploits/clipflip-gui/main/v2dev'))()``
